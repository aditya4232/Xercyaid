# Frontend Development with Tailwind CSS

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling the new Firebase-based frontend pages (`login_firebase.html`, `app_main.html`).

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm: Ensure Node.js (which includes npm) is installed on your system. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    If you haven't already, or if you've cloned the repository fresh, navigate to the project root directory (where `package.json` is located) in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, and any other development dependencies listed in `package.json`.

## Building CSS

The project is configured to compile Tailwind CSS from an input file (`src/main/webapp/css/input.css`) into an output file (`src/main/webapp/css/style.css`). This `style.css` is the file that should be linked in your HTML/JSP pages.

To compile the CSS and watch for changes during development:

1.  **Open your terminal** and navigate to the project root directory.
2.  **Run the build script:**
    ```bash
    npm run build:css
    ```
    This command will:
    *   Process `src/main/webapp/css/input.css`.
    *   Scan all files specified in the `content` array of `tailwind.config.js` (currently `*.html`, `*.jsp`, `*.js` files within `src/main/webapp/`) for Tailwind utility classes.
    *   Generate the corresponding CSS rules and output them to `src/main/webapp/css/style.css`.
    *   The `--watch` flag means the script will keep running and automatically regenerate `style.css` whenever you make changes to `input.css`, your Tailwind configuration, or any of the scanned HTML/JSP/JS files.

3.  **Keep the script running** in the terminal while you are making frontend changes.

## One-off Build for Production/Deployment

If you need to generate the `style.css` file once (e.g., for a deployment or if you don't need the watch mode), you can modify the `build:css` script in `package.json` by removing the `--watch` flag, or add a new script like:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build:css": "tailwindcss -i ./src/main/webapp/css/input.css -o ./src/main/webapp/css/style.css --watch",
  "build:css-prod": "tailwindcss -i ./src/main/webapp/css/input.css -o ./src/main/webapp/css/style.css --minify"
}
```
Then run:
```bash
npm run build:css-prod
```
The `--minify` flag is recommended for production builds to reduce file size.

## How it Works

*   `src/main/webapp/css/input.css`: Contains the basic Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`). You can also add custom CSS here if needed.
*   `tailwind.config.js`: Configures Tailwind, including the paths to your template files where utility classes are used.
*   `postcss.config.js`: Configures PostCSS, which Tailwind uses under the hood (e.g., for Autoprefixer).
*   `src/main/webapp/css/style.css`: The generated stylesheet that is actually used by the web application. **Do not edit this file directly**, as it will be overwritten by the build process.

Make sure your HTML/JSP files link to `css/style.css`:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```
Or for JSPs, using context path:
```jsp
<link rel="stylesheet" href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/css/style.css">
```

# Firebase Integration (Frontend Authentication)

The `login_firebase.html` and `app_main.html` pages use Firebase for user authentication.

## Firebase Setup

**Crucial:** Before the Firebase authentication will work, you need to set up your own Firebase project and configure the application.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Click on "Add project" and follow the steps to create a new project.

2.  **Add a Web App to Your Firebase Project:**
    *   In your new Firebase project's dashboard, click on the Web icon (`</>`) to add a web application.
    *   Register your app (you can give it any nickname). Firebase hosting is not required for this step.

3.  **Get Your Firebase Configuration:**
    *   After registering the app, Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` JavaScript object. This object contains your project's unique API keys and identifiers. It will look something like this:
        ```javascript
        const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
          authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
          projectId: "your-project-id",
          storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
          messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
          appId: "1:123456789012:web:abcdef1234567890abcdef"
        };
        ```

4.  **Update `firebase-init.js`:**
    *   Open the file `src/main/webapp/js/firebase-init.js` in this project.
    *   **Replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` object with the actual `firebaseConfig` object you obtained from your Firebase project.**
    *   This step is essential for the application to connect to your Firebase backend.

5.  **Enable Email/Password Authentication in Firebase:**
    *   In the Firebase console, navigate to "Authentication" (under Build).
    *   Go to the "Sign-in method" tab.
    *   Enable the "Email/Password" provider and save.

## Firebase JavaScript Files

*   `src/main/webapp/js/firebase-init.js`: Contains the Firebase project configuration and initializes the Firebase app. **You must edit this file with your project's details.**
*   `src/main/webapp/js/auth_login_page.js`: Handles authentication logic (login, registration) for `login_firebase.html`.
*   `src/main/webapp/js/auth_main_page.js`: Handles authentication state checking and logout functionality for `app_main.html`.

The HTML files (`login_firebase.html`, `app_main.html`) include the necessary Firebase SDKs (for App and Auth) and these JavaScript files.
